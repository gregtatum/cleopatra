/**
 * Symbolication Overview
 *
 * Symbolication is the process of looking up function names for native code and
 * assigning those function names to the functions in the profile.
 *
 * When the profiler samples call stacks for native code, it only collects
 * addresses: the address of the instruction which is currently being executed,
 * and the "return addresses" for its callers on the stack, i.e. the addresses
 * of the instructions that will be executed after each function returns.
 * To obtain a profile with function names, these addresses need to be
 * translated into library-relative offsets, looked up per library, and then
 * substituted with the corresponding function name strings in the profile.
 *
 * The actual lookup of symbols is not handled in this file; it is delegated to
 * an AbstractSymbolStore interface.
 *
 * The functions in this file perform the following tasks:
 *  - assigning addresses to their containing libraries so that they can be
 *    translated into library-relative offsets
 *  - gathering all addresses in the profile which require symbolication,
 *    grouped by library, and requesting symbols from the symbol store
 *  - once the results from the symbol store come in, performing the
 *    substutitions in the profile.
 *
 * Implementation details
 *
 * The implementation has the following constraints:
 *  - Symbolication needs to be asynchronous, and the profile needs to be fully
 *    interactive before symbols have arrived. This means that there needs to
 *    be an intact funcTable from the very start, because the call nodes for
 *    the call tree are based on funcs.
 *  - When the symbols arrive, we cannot mutate the profile in-place. Instead,
 *    we need to delegate the profile mutation to our caller so that it can go
 *    through redux actions and reducers; the profile is part of the redux state
 *    so any profile adjustment needs to follow proper procedure. This allows
 *    all derived data and UI that depends on profile contents to be notified
 *    and updated in the regular ways.
 *    It also allows multiple steps of symbolication to happen in one redux
 *    store update, which saves re-renders if symbol results for many small
 *    libraries arrive at nearly the same time.
 *  - When symbols arrive, the user shouldn't "lose their place" in the call
 *    tree UI; concretely this means that the selected call node and the set of
 *    expanded call nodes should survive symbolication-triggered adjustments of
 *    the funcTable as much as possible. More specifically, if all frames that
 *    used to be assigned to function A get reassigned to function B, we want to
 *    create an A -> B entry in an oldFuncToNewFuncMap that gets dispatched in
 *    a redux action so that the appropriate parts of the redux state can react.
 *  - Multiple processes and threads in the profile will require symbols from
 *    the same set of native libraries, and the number and size of the
 *    symbolication requests for each library should be minimized. This means
 *    that we want to gather all needed addresses across the entire profile
 *    first, rather than requesting symbols separately for each thread.
 *
 * There are two symbolication scenarios: "Initial symbolication" and
 * "re-symbolication". Initial symbolication is the common case: It's kicked off
 * right after converting a Gecko profile into a processed profile.
 * Re-symbolication is the rarer case - it is invoked by an explicit user action,
 * from a button that's hidden away in a panel, and is only necessary if, for
 * some reason, the symbols obtained during initial symbolication were
 * incomplete or otherwise incorrect.
 *
 * Symbolication happens in a number of phases.
 *
 * I. Preparation during profile processing: When native code addresses initially
 * arrive in the Firefox profiler, they come in the form of hex strings in the
 * frame table of the Gecko profile. Profile processing then does the following:
 *  - It detects frames of native code based on the hex string format.
 *  - It looks up the containing library for each address.
 *  - For each native frame, it creates one funcTable entry. It can't really do
 *    any better at this point because it would need to have the symbols in
 *    order to create only one func per actual function. So, to repeat, the
 *    initial funcTable has one func per native frame.
 *  - The frame and its func both get their address field set to the
 *    library-relative offset.
 *  - The func's resource field is set to a resource of type "library" that
 *    points to the lib object in the thread's "libs" list that contained this
 *    address. The frame's and func's address fields are relative to that lib.
 *
 * II. Address gathering per library: This step goes through all threads and
 * gathers up addresses per library that need to be symbolicated. It also keeps
 * around enough per-thread information so that the per-thread substitution step
 * at the end can perform its work efficiently.
 *
 * III. Symbol lookup: Handled by the AbstractSymbolStore.
 *
 * IV. Symbol result processing: Forwards the symbol lookup result to the caller,
 * expecting a future call to applySymbolicationStep.
 *
 * V. Profile substitution: Invoked from from a thunk action. Processes the
 * symbolication result, groups frame addresses by func addresses, finds or
 * creates funcs for these funcAddresses, and creates a new thread
 * object with an updated frameTable, funcTable and stringTable, with the
 * symbols substituted in the right places. This usually causes many funcs to
 * be orphaned (no frames will use them any more); these orphaned funcs remain
 * in the funcTable. It also creates the oldFuncToNewFuncMap.
 *
 * Re-symbolication only re-runs phases II through V. At the beginning of
 * re-symbolication, the frameTable and funcTable are in the state that the
 * previous symbolication left them in. If the previous symbolication merged
 * functions based on an incomplete symbol table, and re-symbolication has a
 * more detailed symbol table with finer-grained function symbols to work with,
 * then re-symbolication needs to split funcs up again. Splitting up funcs
 * means that a collection of frames which were all using the same func before
 * re-symbolication will be assigned to multiple funcs after re-symbolication.
 * This is different to initial symbolication, which only ever needs to *merge*
 * funcs, not split them, because the initial profile starts out in a
 * "maximally-split" state: every frame has its own function at the beginning of
 * initial symbolication.
 * When funcs are merged, oldFuncToNewFuncMap lets us update other parts of the
 * redux state that refer to func indexes. But when funcs are split, this is not
 * possible. But since function splitting is the rare case, we accept this
 * imperfection.
 *
 * Example for oldFuncToNewFuncMap:
 *
 * Let's say we have a frameTable [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and all frames are
 * from the same lib. Profile processing creates an initial funcTable with one
 * func per frame: [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I].
 * Now let's say we have two samples with the following frame stacks:
 * 0-1-2-3-4 and 0-1-2-3-7. At the beginning, these are the call paths
 * A-B-C-D-E and A-B-C-D-H. ("Call paths" are stacks that, rather than being
 * made of frames, are made of the frames' corresponding funcs.)
 * The user selects the call node with the call path A-B-C-D-H in the call tree.
 * Now we look up symbols for all frame addresses, and frames 4 and 7 turn out
 * to belong to the same function. We choose function E as the shared function.
 * We update the thread with an oldFuncToNewFuncMap that contains an entry H -> E.
 * This collapses both call paths into the call path A-B-C-D-E, and A-B-C-D-E
 * becomes the selected call node.
 * Now, let's say initial symbolication used an incomplete symbol table that
 * mapped the addresses for frames 0,1,2,3 to one function and 4,5,6,7,8 to
 * another function, so our samples' call paths both become A-A-A-A-E. We update
 * the thread and the selected call path, which is now A-A-A-A-E.
 * Luckily, bad symbols leave the frame addresses intact: Our samples still have
 * the frame stacks 0-1-2-3-4 and 0-1-2-3-7, it's only their corresponding call
 * paths which are A-A-A-A-E.
 * Now we re-symbolicate the profile with a good symbol table, and frames 0 to 3
 * are assigned to different functions again; this time we happened to pick the
 * assignment 0 -> A, 1 -> D, 2 -> B, 3 -> C. So now our samples' call paths
 * become A-D-B-C-E.
 * There is no way to choose oldFuncToNewFuncMap so that the selected call path
 * A-A-A-A-E can become A-D-B-C-E. So in the case of splitting functions we
 * accept that the current selection is lost and that some expanded call nodes
 * will close.
